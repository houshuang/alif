# Next session — Polyglot continuation

Self-contained briefing for the future Claude session that picks up this work.
Read this FIRST before touching anything under `polyglot/`. Also read
`polyglot/CLAUDE.md` (project rules + gates audit) and the root
`/Users/stian/src/alif/CLAUDE.md` (especially the new "Polyglot" bullet).

## Done in the 2026-05-20 session (cumulative)

Four PRs landed (squash-merged, branches deleted):

- **PR #3 (this session) — `sentence_selector` + minimal `build_session` port**.
  Read-side spine: `pick_sentence_for_lemma(db, lemma_id, language_code,
  exclude_sentence_ids=None)` returns the best Sentence for a due lemma, or
  `None` if no eligible row exists (defer to generation in PR #4). Source
  preference: (1) page-first when ALL content scaffold lemmas are
  `known`/`learning` (3× score bonus, `selection_reason="page_first_all_known"`),
  (2) any harvested sentence scored by `(0.3 + 0.7 × comprehensibility) ×
  source_bonus`, (3) `None`. Function words and proper names excluded from
  scaffold counting (via `FUNCTION_WORD_SETS[language_code]` AND
  `Lemma.word_category`). Canonical resolution at function entry (Hard
  Invariant #9). Respects `is_active` + `mappings_verified_at` (Hard
  Invariant #2). `build_session` walks acquisition-due (Box 1→2→3) then
  FSRS-due, picks one sentence per lemma, dedupes sentence_id within session,
  caps at `limit`. New endpoints `GET /api/reviews/next-sentence?lemma_id&
  language_code` (returns SentencePayload or null) and `GET /api/reviews/
  session?language_code&limit` (returns list[SentencePayload]). Backend
  tests: **134 passing** (was 113). Gates audit row "No bare word cards"
  flipped from Partial → Ported; "Session builder" and "Comprehensibility
  gate" updated.

Three PRs landed earlier in the session:

- **PR #2 (was #90) — `sentence_review_service` port**. Write-side spine of
  the sentence-review pipeline: one comprehension signal (understood /
  partial / no_idea) distributed across every content lemma in the sentence,
  honouring Hard Invariant FOUNDATIONAL ("every word earns review credit").
  Function words and proper names skipped, suspended skipped, variants
  redirected at entry, encountered/unknown auto-promoted via
  `start_acquisition`, daily-cap deferred path bumps `total_encounters`
  without a review, acquiring vs FSRS routing, post-submit ReviewLog tagging
  with `credit_type` + `was_confused` + `sentence_id`, sentence-level audit
  row in new `sentence_review_log` table, idempotency via composite
  `client_review_id`, undo restores pre-state from `fsrs_log_json`. New
  endpoints `POST /api/reviews/submit-sentence` and `POST /api/reviews/undo-sentence`.
  Schema deltas (additive) on `ReviewLog`: `credit_type`, `was_confused`.
  Backend tests: **113 passing** (was 92 at session start). Gates audit row
  "No bare word cards" moved to **Partially ported** (write-side ready,
  read-side pending PR #3).

Previously landed earlier in the session:

- **PR #88** — Canonical-resolver leak fix. Plugged 5 ULK-creation sites
  that bypassed `resolve_canonical_lemma_id` — the Alif "36 variant ULKs"
  2026-05-06 incident in waiting. Sites fixed: `fsrs_service.submit_review`,
  `acquisition_service.submit_acquisition_review`, `reading_intake.mark_lemma`
  (all non-unknown branches), and the two cognate paths
  (`propagate_known_via_cognate`, `_auto_mark_known`). Regression suite
  asserts variant-in → canonical-out on every entry point.
- **PR #89** — Sentence harvest from textbook pages. New service
  `sentence_harvest.py` walks PageWord rows and emits Sentence +
  SentenceWord rows grouped by `sentence_index`. New schema columns
  `Sentence.page_id` + `sentence_index_in_page` for provenance + idempotency
  (unique constraint). Auto-triggered from `process_page` after quality
  gate; bulk re-harvest via `POST /api/texts/{story_id}/extract-sentences`.
  SentenceWord stores canonical lemma_id (defense-in-depth at storage
  rather than read time). Caps-heading sentences and pure-punctuation
  artefacts are skipped.

Also reconciled doc drift: `polyglot/CLAUDE.md` gates table previously said
"resolver not wired" (was already wired in PR #85). Now accurately lists
all 7 redirect sites.

Backend tests: **92 passing** (was 78 at session start).

## What's next — sentence-review pipeline port (2 PRs remaining)

Per Stian's 2026-05-20 direction ("full Alif port, one branch + multiple
PRs as I land pieces"), the remaining work breaks down as:

- **PR #4 — Greek-tuned `material_generator` port** (next). Port from
  `backend/app/services/material_generator.py` (2.5 KLOC). LLM-generated
  sentences for due lemmas where no textbook sentence covers them — i.e.
  the cases where PR #3's picker returns `None`. New Greek prompt (no
  tashkeel, simplemma for output verification). Mandatory verification
  gate (Hard Invariant). `claude_sonnet` via CLI for batch paths. Cron
  `warm_sentence_cache`. Branch: `sh/polyglot-material-generator`.
- **PR #5 — frontend sentence-bearing review UI**. Update
  `frontend/app/polyglot-review.tsx` to call `/api/reviews/session` and
  render a sentence-shaped card (text, tap-for-gloss, 1–4 rating).
  Replaces the bare-word UX from PR #86. Preserve offline reconciliation
  (`client_review_id`). Flip Hard Invariant #12 if intro cards land here
  too (port `experiment_intro_shown_at` + `_intro_shown_recently`).
  Branch: `sh/polyglot-sentence-review-ui`.

**Recommendation for the next session**: start with PR #4. The picker
now exists and will return `None` for any due lemma without a covering
Sentence row — that's the gap PR #4 fills via LLM generation. After
PR #4 lands, the loop is functional backend-end (UI is still bare-word
from PR #86, sentences exist and submit via PR #2).

Suggested PR #4 entry points to read first in the new session:
- `backend/app/services/material_generator.py` — the generation pipeline
  (~2.5 KLOC). Single sentence and batch paths; the bounded legacy batch
  path (`batch_generate_material` / `generate_material_for_word`) is
  what production uses today.
- Skip Arabic-specifics: tashkeel, clitic stripping in verification,
  awzān-weighted prompts, Hindawi-tier seed selection, the
  `sentence_self_correct.py` tool-enabled session (it's gated off in
  Alif as of 2026-05-12 due to empty-result failures).
- New Greek prompt template: no tashkeel, simplemma to verify the
  generated sentence's lemma assignments, function-word exclusion via
  `FUNCTION_WORD_SETS[language_code]`.
- Mandatory verification gate (Hard Invariant #2): every generated
  sentence must pass `lemma_quality.verify_page_lemmas` (or equivalent
  per-sentence variant) before `mappings_verified_at` is stamped.
  Without it, the picker will reject the row.
- Cron warm: a background job that pre-generates for the top-N due
  lemmas missing material — mirrors Alif's `update_material.py`.

Open scope from the original 2026-05-19 briefing — quality gate
improvements (all-caps Greek headings via sentence-case in verify prompt,
Haiku cost-discipline experiment), Ancient Greek + Latin paths (OdyCy,
LatinCy), audio (Greek TTS via ElevenLabs) — remains untouched but is
lower priority than the sentence-review pipeline per Stian's direction.

## Done in the 2026-05-19 overnight pass

Three back-to-back PRs landed on main (all squash-merged, branches deleted):

- **PR #84** — Quality-gate fixes: caps-heading identity-skip bypass,
  partial-failure idempotency (`mappings_verified_at` stays NULL when any
  batch fails), heading detection (≥80% all-caps + ≤10 tokens), Sonnet/
  Haiku alias routing via `POLYGLOT_QG_MODEL`.
- **PR #85** — FSRS + acquisition + leech engine ported. Files:
  `services/{canonical_resolution,interaction_logger,activity_log,
  fsrs_service,acquisition_service,leech_service}.py` + new `reviews`
  router. New schema columns on `ReviewLog`: `client_review_id` (unique,
  for offline idempotency), `comprehension_signal`. Schema deltas applied
  idempotently by `database.ensure_schema()` on startup.
- **PR #86** — Review tab frontend: transitional bare-word UX over the
  SRS engine. New screen `app/polyglot-review.tsx`, API client gains
  `getDueLemmas`/`submitReview`/`getReviewStats`. Tab gated to Modern
  Greek mode.

End-to-end loop now works without sentence generation: mark unknown →
Box 1 → review (rate Again/Hard/Good/Easy) → graduates via Tier 0/1/2/3
→ enters FSRS. Leech detection runs after every review and on bulk sweep.

Test counts after this overnight pass:
- Polyglot backend: **78 tests passing** (was 35 at start)
- Frontend: **84 tests passing** (unchanged — typecheck covers the new screen)

Files modified at `polyglot/CLAUDE.md` — gates audit table now lists
FSRS/Acquisition/Leech/Variant-resolver/Daily-cap as **Ported**, with
inline notes on the intentional intro-card-gate omission (see Hard
Invariant #12). `polyglot/README.md` now has a full lifecycle diagram +
endpoint table + tier graduation table + leech description.

What's still deferred from this briefing (open scope below):

## Context

Stian has been building Alif (Arabic learning) for 100 days. On 2026-05-19 we
forked the architecture to add Modern Greek (+ later Ancient Greek + Latin).
The new backend lives at `polyglot/` — separate Python package, separate venv,
separate SQLite, FastAPI on port 3001. **Do not confuse `backend/` (Alif) and
`polyglot/` (Greek).** Frontend is shared; the Globe tab in the bottom bar
switches active language.

The MVP reading-as-mapping loop works end-to-end:
- Import the Greek history textbook (298 pages, lazy).
- Tap unknown words while reading; mark known/unknown/encountered/ignore.
- Next-page presumes everything you didn't tap is known.
- LLM quality gate verifies simplemma's lemma assignments in context (catches
  homographs like χώρα/χωρώ).
- Tiny English gloss fetched on-demand when marked unknown.
- Modern↔Ancient Greek cognate auto-linking + propagation.

## What the user wants next

Verbatim from the user's message that prompted this file:

> we need to continue on all the quality issues and sentence review,
> fsrf with all the bells and whistles of alif (leitner, long term etc).

Concrete priorities:

### 1. Port Alif's sentence-review pipeline to polyglot

**Status: SRS engine landed (PR #85). Sentence harvest landed (PR #89).
sentence_review_service landed (PR #2 of the 2026-05-20 sequence).
sentence_selector + minimal build_session landed (PR #3 of the 2026-05-20
sequence). Remaining: material_generator (PR #4), frontend sentence-review
UI (PR #5). See "What's next" section above for the concrete PR breakdown.**

Files still to port from `backend/app/services/`:

- `material_generator.py` (~2.5 KLOC) — sentence generation for lemmas
  where the picker returns `None`. Will need a Greek-tuned prompt
  (different sentence rules, different difficulty signals from Arabic).

When this lands, also flip Hard Invariant #12 in `polyglot/CLAUDE.md`
(intro-card working-memory gate) from "intentionally omitted" to "ported"
by adding `UserLemmaKnowledge.experiment_intro_shown_at` and porting
`_intro_shown_recently` from Alif's acquisition_service. Without it,
Tier 0/1/2 graduation can fire on tight time scales — fine for solo
dogfood, dangerous if polyglot ships to others.

Important: see `polyglot/CLAUDE.md` "Hard invariants" — keep the **quality
gate is mandatory** discipline. When sentence generation lands, every
generated sentence must go through verify-and-correct (the same way Alif's
`generate_material_for_word` requires verification). Don't add a separate
generation path that skips it — that's how Alif accumulated 29 bad mappings
in March (see CLAUDE.md root, "Hard Invariants").

The **canonical lemma scheduling invariant** is fully wired as of the
2026-05-20 follow-up (see Done section above) — all current ULK-creation
sites redirect through `resolve_canonical_lemma_id` at function entry, with
regression tests. **When the sentence-review pipeline lands, any new
ULK-creation sites it introduces must add the same redirect at entry —
don't trust callers** (Hard Invariant #9). Sentence review will additionally
need `resolve_canonical_via_map` for batch session-builder hot paths.

### 2. Quality gate improvements

The current gate (`lemma_quality.py`) catches homographs + POS errors well
but has gaps:

- **All-caps Greek headings.** PDFs typeset headings in caps without accents,
  so "ΠΟΛΙΤΙΣΜΟΙ" doesn't match simplemma's lowercase-accented dictionary.
  The gate currently leaves these as the lowercased-no-accent form. Either:
  (a) restore accents pre-lookup using a frequency-list match, or
  (b) include the original sentence-case in the verify prompt and let
  Claude propose the citation form. Probably (b) — cheaper.
- **All-caps eligibility filtering.** Should we even try to lemmatize Greek
  all-caps headings? They're often section-numbering or chapter titles
  that don't contribute to vocabulary learning. Could mark headings as
  `is_function_word=True` heuristically (e.g. > 80% uppercase + ≤ 10 words
  on the line).
- **Cost discipline.** Sonnet runs ~$0.30-0.50/page. Max plan covers it but
  consider whether Haiku could handle the "verify if simplemma got it
  right" task. Haiku is 10x cheaper and the task isn't super hard.
- **Idempotency on partial failure.** If Claude times out mid-batch,
  the function logs and continues. Currently `mappings_verified_at` still
  gets stamped — should it? Consider not stamping if any batch returned
  None; force a re-verify next time.

### 3. Sentence review for the Modern Greek learner

The user's reading flow lets them mark words as `unknown`. Those should then
flow into a sentence-review queue. Concrete UX needed:

- **New tab** in Modern-Greek mode: "Review" (next to "Reading" and the
  Globe).
- **Session loop**: pull next sentence for due ULKs, show it, accept
  comprehension signal (understood / partial / no_idea), apply FSRS update,
  next.
- **Where sentences come from**: must include the textbook page where the
  lemma was first marked unknown (zero-friction — the user already read
  that page). Then LLM-generated sentences using `unknown` + adjacent
  `acquiring` words.
- **Cognate-rich sentences**: when generating, prefer sentences that mix
  the target word with words the user has marked known via L1 cognate.
  This is unique to polyglot — Alif doesn't have an equivalent because
  Arabic has fewer transparent cognates.

### 4. Ancient Greek + Latin paths

OdyCy (spaCy-based, 94.4% lemmatization on UD-PROIEL) for Ancient Greek.
LatinCy for richer Latin morphology. Both are stubbed in
`app/services/languages/grc.py` and `la.py` with `ProviderUnavailable`
fallback. Install + smoke-test on a real text:

- Ancient Greek: `~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Greek/Textbooks/22-0244-02_Sofokleous-Antigoni_Thoukydidi-Perikleous-Epitafios_B-Lykeiou_Vivlio-Mathiti.pdf`
  (Sophocles + Thucydides). Or any other AG text in the same folder.
- Latin: `~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Greek/Textbooks/Λατινικά-Γ-Λυκείου-Σημειώσεις.pdf`
  (Latin notes for Greek high schoolers).

simplemma handles both languages too, so the GR-grade fallback is the same
pattern as Modern Greek.

### 5. Audio (deferred but plan it)

Greek TTS via ElevenLabs `eleven_multilingual_v2` should just work (it's the
same model Alif uses for Arabic). Voice IDs different. Cost discipline like
Alif: only generate audio for sentences that will be shown. Add a
"Listening" mode for Greek after reading + review are solid.

## Deployment status

Polyglot deployed to Hetzner alongside Alif:
- Code: `/opt/alif/polyglot/`
- venv: `/opt/alif/polyglot/.venv/`
- systemd: `polyglot-backend` on port 3001 (managed by `polyglot-backend.service`)
- DB: `/opt/alif/polyglot/polyglot.db`
- Frontend's `app.json` has `polyglotApiUrl` pointing to the server.

Deploy command (mirrors Alif's pattern):
```bash
ssh alif "cd /opt/alif && git pull && cd polyglot && .venv/bin/pip install -e . --no-deps -q && systemctl restart polyglot-backend"
```

## Working knowledge

Helpful context for the next session:

- **simplemma is enough for the common path.** GR-NLP-TOOLKIT downloads ~500
  MB at first use and adds POS/morphology/dep/NER — useful for future
  grammar features but NOT for lemmas (it doesn't have a lemmatizer).
- **HuggingFace cache redirect.** `app/services/languages/el.py` sets
  `HF_HOME` to project-local at module-import time. Critical: must run
  before any transformers import. Don't move it.
- **Claude CLI `--json-schema` puts output in `structured_output`,
  not `result`.** Easy to regress. Look at `_call_claude` in
  `lemma_quality.py` for the parsing pattern.
- **The DB has been wiped many times during this session.** When you start,
  expect either an empty `polyglot.db` or a textbook with page 11
  processed + bulk-marked. Re-importing the PDF is fast (~1s).

## Useful one-liners

```bash
# Run polyglot dev server with quality gate enabled
cd /Users/stian/src/alif/polyglot
POLYGLOT_QUALITY_GATE=1 .venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --port 3001

# Run tests
.venv/bin/python -m pytest                    # fast (30 tests)
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -m slow            # slow (real Claude calls)

# Smoke test the full reading flow (no UI)
.venv/bin/python -c "from fastapi.testclient import TestClient; from app.main import app; ..."
# See polyglot/CLAUDE.md "Development workflow" for full examples.

# Reset DB (lose all work; useful when testing schema changes)
rm polyglot.db polyglot.db-shm polyglot.db-wal
```

## Don't get confused

If you find yourself thinking "I'll add this to the backend", check:
- `pwd` — am I in `backend/` or `polyglot/`?
- The function name — is it called from Alif's pipeline or Polyglot's?
- The data model — `Lemma.lemma_ar` is Arabic-only; `Lemma.language_code +
  lemma_form` is polyglot's pattern.

Each backend has its own venv and pyproject.toml. If you `pip install`
something, do it in the polyglot venv. If you edit a service in `backend/`,
that's Arabic-only.

The frontend is shared. Edits to `frontend/app/_layout.tsx` and
`frontend/lib/language-context.tsx` affect both languages. Polyglot-specific
frontend code lives in `frontend/app/polyglot*.tsx` and
`frontend/lib/polyglot-api.ts`.
