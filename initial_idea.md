Duolingo clone development strategy
- A Duolingo clone needs to figure out the easiest way to make a native mobile app with local storage and sync. It needs to keep track of the words I know, tracking words on multiple levels: roots, words, and the actual grammatical forms. I guess the main one is the words, but if I click on a word and I'm shown the root, the non-conjugated version, and I say that I know the word, then we should keep track of that.
- We probably need some libraries for conjugating words and extracting roots and so on to avoid the use of too much LLM. We also need to be able to generate sentences using words that I know or only certain words I don't know. As the list of words I know grows larger, we probably need to combine LLM with database lookups to check sentences. We might also have some patterns, like "the X is Y," or "the car is blue," to quickly generate sentences that we want to test out.
- I'm not sure whether we really need the input interface of Duolingo or whether a spaced repetition interface is more efficient if I trust myself not to cheat. But I still need to be shown probably the reading and the translation to double-check my work. Then I should probably be able to mark the words I didn't know.
- I should be able to import lists of words that I should know. They should not be given a full mark, but that should be evidence that I have some knowledge of them, and also that they are relevant to keep up to date. I should be able to insert a text that I want to be able to read and for it to make a plan to train me to read that text by extracting the difficult words, the words I don't know, and systematically training me on those until I'm ready to read the text.
- Perhaps also the ability to rewrite a text into a desired difficulty level and the ability to gloss a text for producing PDFs, for example, based on the knowledge it has of my ability. We also need the ability to create a curriculum that is structured based on word frequency and maybe domain, utilizing the power of roots. So if you learn KTB, then learning Maktaba, Maktab, Kataba, etc., are very productive. Even identifying patterns like how you turn a word into a machine would be useful if you have a lot of kitchen appliances, etc. Any kind of shortcut that helps you, focused purely on comprehension, would be valuable.
- Using 11 Labs to generate audio for all the sentences and then generating stories and practicing both reading a story, the vocabulary, but also listening, maybe practicing listening to each sentence individually. So one mode could be just listening where you don't see anything and you try to catch what it is. Then you can read it, then you can re-listen. Once you've listened to all the sentences, you can listen to the whole story.
